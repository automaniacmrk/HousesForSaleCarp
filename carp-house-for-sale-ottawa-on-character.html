One quarter of the remaining housing stock consists of townhouses built after 2000, when Carp experienced its greatest building boom. A small percentage (less than 10%), of row homes can also be found in this area. These houses have four bedrooms, but not more than five.</p><h2>Amazing Surroundings</h2><p>Carp Lake, a small lake located in Pierce County Washington. In every direction, there are bodies of water equal to or larger than the lake. To the north are a few lake visitors: the much larger Steilacoom Lake, Lake Louise, and Waughop Lake.</p><p>Two large lakes lie to the south: American Lake, and Gravelly Lake. Carp Lake lies east of the borders of two large water bodies: Nisqually Reach, and Carr Inlet.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HousesForSaleCarp/authors/agent/" rel="author">Agent</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HousesForSaleCarp/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HousesForSaleCarp/carp-house-for-sale-listings.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Carp House for Sale Listings</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:24" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HousesForSaleCarp/carp-house-for-sale-listings.html">Carp House for Sale Listings</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T09:22" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HousesForSaleCarp/houses-for-sale-carp.html">Houses For Sale Carp</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>House For Sale Carp</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/HousesForSaleCarp/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
