<h2>How to do it</h2>
<p>Carp Lake has many outdoor and watersports opportunities.</p>
<p>There are many things to do around Carp Lake, including American Lake. Residents and visitors can hire jet skis or kayaks to get on the water. American Lake is the largest natural lake in Pierce County.</p>
<p>American Lake is also a good place to fish. There is however no shoreline fishing available. Individuals must fish from the water. On the northern side of the lake, closest to Carp Lake is the American Lake Park. The park provides a range of services for its visitors.</p>
<p>You can see mountains, coast, and forest as the backdrop to the park and lake. A picnic area, children's playground, and boat launch are all available. The picnic area is available to rent for half-day or full days.</p>
<h2>Carp House for Sale Listings</h2>
<p>Check out these<a href="https://www.labrosserealestate.com/buyers/houses-for-sale-carp/"> real estate listings in Carp</a> if you are interested. You might also consider looking into Dunrobin or the more Rural areas of West Carleton.</p>
<p>This little village has now expanded to become large enough to stand out from the other small towns in the area. Located in the township of Huntley, and named after the Carp River that runs through the area, the population of this small village is around 9,000 people. Every Saturday, the Carp Farmer's Market is open from April/May through October. Local fresh produce can be found there. If you can't make it to Carp there are other markets nearby. Carp typically sees 30-40 home sales each year. This isn't a large area, but it does have a lot of potential buyers.</p>
<p>There have been 3 years of home price declines since 2000, and 6 years where there has been a double-digit increase in home prices. Carps main attraction is Diefenbunker. It was built as an underground top-secret bunker in order to shelter the Prime Minister and other government officials during a nuclear attack on Ottawa. It is now Canada's Cold War museum located just north of the village. In 1992, an UFO landing was made at the Diefenbunker. The Carp Fair takes place every September.</p>
